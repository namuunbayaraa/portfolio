#### Purpose & Scope

This project involved the transformation of a legacy, monolithic in-house CRM application built on .NET into a modern architecture leveraging React and NodeJS. The goal was to create a scalable, service-enabled backend and a componentized frontend to improve system performance, enable cross-enterprise collaboration, and deliver innovative features for better user engagement and business outcomes.

#### Design & Planning

**Legacy System Analysis:** Conducted a comprehensive review of the existing CRM to identify pain points, bottlenecks, and opportunities for improvement.

**Stakeholder Collaboration:** Engaged with teams across data, analytics, and product to define requirements, align objectives, and prioritize features.

**Modern Architecture Design:** Designed a microservices-based backend architecture and a modular frontend to enhance maintainability and scalability.

#### Development Process

**Service-Enabled Backend:** Rebuilt the backend using NodeJS with RESTful APIs to enable seamless integration and data flow between systems.

**Componentized Frontend:** Developed reusable, accessible UI components in React, reducing development time and ensuring consistency across the application.

**Data Integration:** Collaborated with enterprise data teams to align data models and implement analytics pipelines, providing actionable insights within the CRM.

**Performance Optimization:** Improved system responsiveness and load times, enhancing the user experience for busy sales teams.

**Collaboration Tools:** Established shared workflows and tools, such as CI/CD pipelines (using Docker and Jenkins), to streamline development and deployment.

#### Challenges

**Cross-Team Alignment:** Coordinating efforts across data, analytics, and product teams required extensive communication and iteration to ensure alignment and minimize delays.

**Scalability:** Designing a system capable of handling increasing user demands while maintaining performance required innovative approaches to architecture and infrastructure.

**User Adoption:** Transitioning users from the legacy CRM to the new system involved change management, training, and continuous feedback to address usability concerns.

#### My Role

As a lead **frontend engineer and project manager**, I:

- Defined the technical strategy and roadmap for the CRM transformation.

- Led cross-functional collaboration between data, analytics, and product teams to ensure cohesive delivery.

- Architected the frontend structure, developed key UI components, and ensured adherence to accessibility standards.

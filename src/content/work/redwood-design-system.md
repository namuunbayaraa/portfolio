## WHY

> Purpose & Scope

Whenever we built new features we found ourselves copying over code, and or a rewriting code to resemble the look with no design resource to guide us. The need for a clearly defined design guideline, resuable components were needed. So the journey to build a design system started. To improve brand consistency across plaforms and teams, speed up development. Kept the scope to internal tools across enterprise.

> Design Audit

Did a thorough analysis of in-use components, design inconsistencies across products and identified core components.

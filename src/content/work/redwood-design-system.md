#### Purpose & Scope

The **Redwood Design System** was developed to address inefficiencies and inconsistencies in the design and development process. Prior to its creation, teams often copied or rewrote code without consistent design resources, leading to fragmented user experiences and slower development cycles. The design system aimed to improve brand consistency, accelerate development speed, and create a unified framework for internal tools across the enterprise.

#### Design & Planning

**Design Audit:** Conducted a comprehensive analysis of existing components and identified design inconsistencies across products. Findings were consolidated into a centralized Figma board to visualize patterns and gaps.

**Research:** Studied established design systems such as Lightning Design, Carbon, and Googleâ€™s Material Design to identify best practices.

**Scope Definition:** Focused on core reusable components and design tokens for the MVP, prioritizing internal tools to deliver immediate impact.

#### Development Process

**Component Development:** Built foundational components, including buttons, input fields, modals, and navigation elements, ensuring they were accessible (WCAG-compliant) and responsive.

**Design Tokens:** Established a centralized set of design tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and more, creating a scalable and consistent visual language.

**Tooling and Documentation:** Used TypeScript and Storybook to develop and document components, enabling seamless collaboration and adoption across teams.

**Team Collaboration:** Facilitated regular reviews and feedback loops with designers, developers, and stakeholders to ensure alignment and usability.

**Iteration:** Continuously refined components based on user feedback and evolving business needs.

#### Challenges

**Alignment Across Teams:** Ensuring alignment between design and development teams was initially challenging due to varying workflows and priorities. We resolved this by hosting cross-functional workshops and creating detailed documentation.

**Scalability:** Balancing the need for scalability with tight timelines required prioritizing the most impactful components for the MVP while leaving room for future expansion.

#### My Role

As both **product owner and developer**, I:

- Defined the vision and roadmap for the Redwood Design System, aligning it with business goals.

- Collaborated with stakeholders to gather requirements and prioritize components based on impact.

- Designed and developed core components, ensuring high-quality code and adherence to accessibility standards.

- Managed sprints and facilitated team collaboration to meet project milestones.

- Led onboarding sessions and provided mentorship to ensure adoption and consistent usage across teams.

#### Impact

**Consistency:** Achieved significant improvements in brand consistency across internal tools, reducing design discrepancies.

**Efficiency:** Enhanced developer productivity by 30% and accelerated feature delivery by 20% through reusable components and clear guidelines.

**Adoption:** The design system was widely adopted across teams, becoming a critical resource for building scalable, user-friendly applications.

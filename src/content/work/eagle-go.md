#### Purpose & Scope

**EagleGO** was a mobile-first, personalized banker dashboard developed to increase deposits and empower bankers to perform efficiently on the go. The project originated as a direct request from the CEO to address two critical pain points: the need for a streamlined tool to support busy bankers and a way to drive business growth through increased deposit generation. The primary goal was to deliver a responsive, user-friendly application tailored to bankers' daily workflows.

#### Design & Planning

**User Research:** We conducted interviews with bankers to understand their workflows, pain points, and feature priorities. This helped us design a tool that fit seamlessly into their daily operations.

**Scope Definition:** Focused on core functionalities, such as real-time client insights, deposit tracking, and personalized alerts, to maximize impact while adhering to tight deadlines.

**Mobile-First Approach:** Given the on-the-go nature of bankers, we prioritized a mobile-first design, ensuring the application was optimized for small screens and responsive across devices.

#### Development Process

**Frontend Development:** Leveraging modern web technologies (React, NodeJS), we built an intuitive and responsive user interface, focusing on simplicity and efficiency.

**Backend Integration:** Collaborated with backend engineers to integrate the dashboard with existing systems, enabling real-time data access and secure transactions.

**Personalization Features:** Implemented a recommendation engine powered by user data analytics, providing bankers with tailored client insights and actionable opportunities.

**Performance Optimization:** Ensured fast load times and seamless interactions, critical for bankers who needed quick access during client meetings.

**Accessibility:** Incorporated WCAG-compliant features, such as high-contrast modes and keyboard navigation, to accommodate all users.

#### Tools & Frameworks

**Frontend:** React, NodeJS

**Design:** Invision, Figma for prototyping and collaboration

**Testing & QA:** Jest, Cypress for robust end-to-end testing

#### Challenges

**Privacy Concerns:** Since the app handled sensitive personal financial information, ensuring data privacy while being accessible on the go was a significant challenge. We addressed this by implementing robust encryption protocols and adhering to strict security standards.

**Technical Constraints:** To meet enterprise-level security requirements, the application had to be wrapped within Microsoft Intune, ensuring all data remained securely within the corporate network. This added complexity to the development and deployment processes, requiring close collaboration with the IT and security teams.

#### My Role

As the **lead frontend developer** on the project, I was responsible for:

Collaborating with designers, backend engineers, and stakeholders to ensure alignment and timely delivery.

Developing core UI components and integrating them with backend APIs.

Managing sprint planning and task prioritization, ensuring the team met tight deadlines.

Conducting code reviews, pair programming with backend engineers and mentoring junior developers.

#### Impact

**Business Growth:** EagleGO contributed to a measurable increase in deposits within the first quarter of launch, directly aligning with the CEOâ€™s strategic goals.

**Efficiency Boost:** Bankers reported significantly improved productivity and satisfaction, with faster access to client data and actionable insights.

**Adoption:** Achieved high adoption rates across banking teams due to its intuitive design and tailored functionality.

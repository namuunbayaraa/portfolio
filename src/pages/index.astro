    <h1>👋 Hi, I'm Namuun!</h1>

    <p>
      Born and raised in Mongolia, I grew up in a multicultural environment,
      completing my secondary education in Russian before moving to the U.S. I
      now call the San Francisco Bay Area home, where I balance my love for 🏃‍♀️
      endurance sports, 👩‍💻 tech, and 🔍 lifelong learning.
    </p>

    <h2>✨ What I Do</h2>
    <p>
      With 7+ years of experience in frontend engineering, I've built enterprise
      fintech applications, internal design systems, and responsive web
      experiences. Now, I’m looking to join a company that is leveraging AI to
      drive innovation and optimization.
    </p>

    <h2>🔥 What Drives Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm obsessed with pushing boundaries—whether in my work or through
      endurance sports. 🏅 As a marathoner and advocate for health, fitness, and
      nutrition, I’m also deeply interested in health tech and food tech, how
      technology can help people optimize performance and live healthier lives.
    </p>
